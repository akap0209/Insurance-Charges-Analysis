# Medical Costs Analysis
By: Alex Kaplan 
##Data Source
The dataset has been extracted from Kaggle. It shows information about a person’s demographics, including their age, sex, body mass index (BMI), whether they smoke or not, and what region in the United States they are from.

##Data Contents
This dataset contains information regarding 1337 people from four geographical regions in the United States. It provides information regarding each person's age, sex, BMI, the number of children they have, if they are a smoker, the region they live in, and the amount of insurance charges they have. 
##Data Cleaning Procedures
One row of duplicated data was removed. The original dataset had a column named "charges" that was renamed to "insurance_charges" to make it more consistent with the dataset. 
##Analysis Objective
The goal of this analysis is to determine which variables contribute the most to someone's medical costs and to see which regions in the United States have the highest medical costs. The analysis will help patients and healthcare providers identify the factors that have the greatest impact on increasing patient insurance charges, so that resources can be allocated more effectively to address these issues.
##Research Questions
1.	Which regions have the highest insurance charges?
2.	Is there a connection between age and insurance charges?
3.	Is there are connection between insurance charges and someone’s BMI?
4.	What impact does smoking have on someone’s insurance charges?
##Data Limitations
The insurance data was collected manually so there could be some errors. There are also only 1339 rows of data which may not be enough of a sample to predict insurance costs for every patient. We also do not know specifically what city or state a patient lives in. The data just provides regions of the US.  Much of this data is limited to patients with access to healthcare, hospitals, and willingness to seek medical treatment so there could be even more insurance costs than this dataset suggests. 
##Data Ethics
The data was collected with the consent of its participants and none of their private information was included. Therefore, there are no ethical concerns with the data.
